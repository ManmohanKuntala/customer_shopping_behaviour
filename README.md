## Customer Shopping Behaviour Analysis

### Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze customer shopping behavior
using transactional data to identify spending patterns, customer
segments, and product performance that can help businesses improve
sales and customer retention strategies.

### Dataset
- Total records: 3,900 customer purchases
- Total features: 18
- Includes customer demographics (age, gender, location),
  purchase details (category, purchase amount, discounts),
  subscription status, and shipping type

### Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Power BI


### Power BI Dashboard
  An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize:
- Customer segmentation
- Revenue trends by category
- Gender and age-based spending patterns


### Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (age groups, purchase frequency)
- Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)
- Spending and revenue analysis by category and gender
- Discount and subscription behavior analysis

### Key Insights
- Young adult customers contributed the highest overall revenue
- Male customers generated significantly higher total revenue
- A small group of repeat customers accounted for a large portion of sales


### Business Recommendations
- Convert repeat buyers into subscribers using exclusive benefits
- Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue customer segments
- Promote top-performing product categories during peak seasons
- Optimize discount strategies to protect profit margins

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to perform end-to-end data analysis
using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and to translate data-driven insights
into actionable business recommendations.
