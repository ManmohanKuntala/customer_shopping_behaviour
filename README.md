  Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploration, cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and business reporting.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them through an interactive Power BI dashboard, a written report, and a presentation created using Gamma.

This project highlights practical skills required for Data Analyst / Business Analyst roles.

 Dataset

~ Source: (Kaggle)
~ Format: CSV
~ Description: The dataset contains structured data related to (briefly mention domain, e.g., sales, customers, operations, finance).

 Tools & Technologies

. Python – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA
. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
. PostgreSQL – Data storage and SQL querying
. SQL – Data analysis and aggregations
. Power BI – Interactive dashboard and visualizations
. Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and documentation

Project Steps

Step 1 -  Data Loading
. Imported dataset into Python using Pandas.
. Loaded cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database.

Step 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
. Analyzed data structure, distributions, and trends.
. Identified missing values and outliers.
. Visualized key metrics using charts and plots.

Step 3 - Data Cleaning
. Handled missing values.
. Removed duplicates.
. Standardized column names and data types.
. Ensured data consistency for analysis.

Step 4 - SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
. Wrote SQL queries for:
. Aggregations and KPIs
. Trend analysis
. Filtering and grouping
. Validated Python results using SQL queries.

Step 5 - Dashboard Development
. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.
. Included filters, KPIs, and trend visuals.


The Power BI dashboard provides:
. Key performance indicators (KPIs)
. Trend analysis over time
. Category-wise and segment-wise breakdowns
. Interactive filters for deeper insights
. Designed for business-friendly insights.
. Reporting & Presentation
. Created a detailed analytical report.
